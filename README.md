# CodecademyProjs
This repository is filled with a lot of files that I've created and built projects on throughout my journey on learning Python on [codecademy](codecademy.org).

Im currently working on a lot of projects throughout the CS course on codecademy, and as I learnt more about Data Structures and Algorithms this list continued to pile on and fill up with projects, and I decided to upload it here to showcase my work.
